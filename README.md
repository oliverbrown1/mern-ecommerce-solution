## Overview

Just started creating a MERN full-stack ecommerce solution. MERN stands for Mongo.db, Express.js, React, Node.js. I am building a foundation for an interesting project using the well known JavaScript-only stack MERN.

This won't end up some e-commerce clone, but is to begin with.

## Current Features

* JWT Authentication -> using refresh + access tokens 
* Redis rate limiting using Upstash
* middleware session management

## Installation

1. Ensure you have the latest version of npm installed.
2. Run ```npm run inst && npm run start``` in the terminal.
3. Open the frontend URL, for now you can just explore pages by editing the pathname in the url.
