## Overview

Just started creating a MERN full-stack ecommerce solution. MERN stands for Mongo.db, Express.js, React, Node.js. I am building a foundation for an interesting project using the well known JavaScript-only stack MERN.

This won't just be some e-commerce clone, but will be to begin with.

## Current Features

* JWT Authentication
* Redis rate limiting using Upstash
* middleware session management
